Here, too, the young Narmada pours down the escarpment in a gushing waterfall and depressions in the water-worn rocks, before the cascade, are said to be the footprints of that powerful seer. The base of the falls, on the rocky banks of the brisk, blue stream that is the Narmada, is a favoured picnic spot with visitors. Those who are a shade more adventurous often opt to trek for a further one kilometer or so to the next Narmada falls: the Dugdh Dhara.</span></span><span style="color: #033d3d; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><br><br></span></span>

<h3>The Fort</h3>
<p>No records remain to show when Bandhavgarh Fort was constructed. It is thought, however, to be some 2,000 years old, and there are references to it in the ancient books, the Narad-Panch Ratra and the Siva Purana. Various dynasties have ruled this fort: for example, the Maghas from the 1st century AD, the Vakatakas from the 3rd century; the Sengars from the 5th century and the Kalchuris from the 10th century. In the 13th century AD, the Baghels took over, ruling from Bandhavgarh until 1617, when Maharajah Vikramaditya Singh moved his capital to Rewa. The last inhabitants deserted the fort in 1935.
 
</p>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>The Flaura and Fauna</h3>
<p>The forest of Bandhavgarh can be classified as moist deciduous, and the National Park holds all those animal species which are typical of this habitat in Central India. Certain areas of the park (particularly the south and the west) are drier in character, and hold such species as the Nilgai and the Chinkara.
Sal forest occurs throughout the valleys, giving way to mixed forest which occurs where the soil is of relatively poor quality on the upper hill slopes, on rocky outcrops and in the South and West. Grassy meadow patches occur in the valley and along the nalas.

<h3>Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya (A POST COLONIAL MUSEUM)</h3>
<p>The Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya (National Museum of Mankind) is a unique Museum, spread over 200 acres of undulating land on the Shamla Hills on the Upper Lake front. It is situated in a prehistoric site and may be the only museum in the world strewn with numerous prehistoric painted rock shelters. It is a post-colonial museum of communities rather than objects, dedicated to in situ revitalisation of local knowledge systems and life enhancing traditions rather than ex situ display of objects. It is engaged in recollection rather than collection. The museum display has been curated directly by the folk and tribal communities, camping at site, to create a miniature presentation of Indian folk ways through display of eco-specific habitations & subsistence practices in the tribal, coastal, desert, and Himalayan habitats. The library, audio-visual archive, computerised documentation and the collection of ethnographic specimens in the Museum, though modest in size are among the best in the world.

<h3>The Fort</h3>
<p>Standing on a steep mass of sandstone, Gwalior Fort dominates the city and is its most magnificent monument. It has been a scene of momentous events : imprisonments, battles and jauhars. A steep road winds upwards to the Fort, flanked by statues of Jain tirthankaras, carved into the rock face. The magnificent outer walls of the Fort still stand, two miles in length and 35 feet high, bearing witness to its reputation for being one of the most invincible forts of India. This imposing structure inspired Emperor Babar to describe it "the pearl amongst the fortresses of Hind." Within the fort are some marvels of medieval architecture. The 15th century Gujari Mahal is a monument to the love of Raja Mansingh Tomar for his Gujar queen, Mrignayani. After he had wooed and won her, so the story goes, Mrignayani demanded that he build her a separate palace with a constant water supply from the River Rai, via an aqueduct. The outer structure of the Gujari Mahal has survived in an almost total state of preservation; the interior has been converted into an Archaeological Museum.
 
Also built by Raja Mansingh is the Man Mandir Palace, built between 1486 and 1517. The tiles that once adorned its exterior have not survived, but at the entrance, traces of these still remain. There is a charming frieze here of ducks paddling in turquoise waters. Within, the palace rooms stand bare, stripped of their former glory, mute testimony to the passing of the centuries. Vast chambers with fine stone screens were once the music halls, and behind these screens, the royal ladies would learn music from the great masters of the day. Below, circular dungeons once housed the state prisoners of the Mughals. The Emperor Aurangzeb had his brother, Murad, imprisoned, and later executed, here. Close by is Jauhar Pond, where in the Rajput tradition, the ‘ranis’ committed mass ‘sati’ after their consorts had been defeated in battle. Though the major portions of the Fort were built in the 15th century, references to this gigantic complex can be traced back to 425 AD. Older than the city is the Suraj Kund within the Fort walls, the original pond where Suraj Sen, or Suraj Pal as he was later known, was cured by the Saint Gwalipa.

<h3>The Sound and Lights Show, Gwalior Fort</h3>
<p>For many decades now, the Fort of Gwalior has slumbered in silence, broken now and then by the patter of curious feet and awed tones.
Come sundown, the deserted Fort is once again left with only memories for company. But now it comes alive every night. Well remembered incidents, and well-loved voices once more echo through its lonely corridors and its dark and sad facade now glows with the colours of life. Red-gold, blue-green lights illuminate every nook and cranny of the superbly tiled 'Man Mandir'. The Gwalior Son-et-Lumiere has begun. The Sound and Light show at the Man Mandir Palace of Gwalior Fort gives you a glimpse into its glorious past. The story of this 'pearl' begins with the sonorous and eloquent narration by Amitabh Bachchan as Gopachal, the sutradhar (narrator).
 
Taking you back in time is the legend of Suraj Sen, the Rajput chieftain who was hunting in the hills and forests around Gwalior. Hopelessly lost and terribly thirsty, Suraj Sen came across the sage Gwalipa who directed him to a pool which would quench his parched throat. After drinking the cool, healing waters of this 'kund', Suraj Sen was cured of a long time ailment-leprosy.
In utter gratitude, according to Gwalipa's wishes, he built a tank and a fort on the site and named the city after this great sage. The Rajputs constructed palaces and temples in the precincts of the fort of which the Sas Bahu ka Mandir and Teli ka Mandir are fine examples. Prolifically carved out of local sandstone, these temples are within the fort itself.
 
For a brief period in history Gwalior stood witness to Turkish invasion and tragic Rajput defeats. Sieges by Mehmood Ghazni and other Muslim kings have been realistically created by the Son-et-Lumiere and 'Jauhar' scenes where Rajput women immolate themselves, are lighting marvels, so life-like they seem to cast a sombre glow over kings who rode out to their last battle.
However, the Rajputs, a fierce and resilient people, did not lose much time in reconquering a lost treasure, and with the Tomar dynasty firmly in the saddle, Gwalior was on the threshold of a great and glorious era. During the reign of Man Singh, the Tomar king, Gwalior saw a flowering of Indian classical music and art. The exquisite 'Man Mandir', Palace of Dreams, was built in his time and so began the most romantic epoch of the Gwalior Fort. Man Singh, a slideupular and just ruler, married a courageous Gujari village belle, Mrignayani, and the tale of their meeting has been beautifully played out in the Son-et-Lumeire. A constant friend and companion, Mrignayani was the perfect consort. Music was their mutual passion and the legendary Baiju Bawra their common guru.
 
In the Son-et-Lumeire, Pt. Jasraj, Bhimsen Joshi and Kumar Gandharva recreate the spiritual grandeur of the Dhrupad tradition as sung by Baiju and Tansen. An illustrious son of Gwalior, Tansen, one of Akbars 'nine jewels' lies buried in the heart of the city, and his tomb is a splendid example of early Mughal architecture. The Son-et-Lumeire vividly reconstructs Mughal rule, at a time when the fort had become a royal prison. The release of Guru Har Gobing Singh has been graphically described as has been the incredible story attached to it.
Then came to power the last dynasty to rule Gwalior before the post -Independence era-the Marathas under Mahadji Scindia. In between, the fort passed briefly into the hands of the British, Laxmibai of Jhansi and Tatiya Tope. But soon enough the Scindias restored Gwalior to its former glory. The imposing Jai Vilas Palace, situated in the city, below the hill top fort, is proof of the Scindia sway. The late Madho Rao Scindia, the architect of modern Gwalior made it one of the best administered former princely states.</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Teli ka Mandir</h3>
<p>The Teli ka Mandir is a 9th century edifice, towering at 100 ft high. This is a Pratihara Vishnu temple of a unique blending of architectural styles. The shape of the roof is distinctively Dravidian, while the decorative embellishments have the typically Indo-Aryan characteristics of Northern India. Also dedicated to Vishnu is the graceful little Sas-Bahu-ka-Mandir, built in 11th century. Another landmark is the historic Gurudwara Data Bandhi Chhod built in the memory of Guru Hargobind Sahib, the 6th Sikh Guru who was imprisoned here by Jehangir for over two years. At the time of his release, he wanted 52 Hindu kings who were his fellow prisoners, released with him. Jehangir was very impressed with the Guru and agreed to his condition. And, finally, within the Fort complex, housed in the erstwhile barracks of the British soldiers, is Gwalior's unique gift to modern India : Scindia School. Acknowledged as one of the finest schools in India, it is only fitting that the country's young citizens receive the best educational grounding surrounded by monuments to a past which is a constant inspiration. </p>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Jai Vilas Palace</h3>
<p>A splendour of a different kind exists in the Jai Vilas Palace, current residence of the Scindia family. Some 35 rooms have been made into the Scindia Museum, and in these rooms, so evocative of a regal lifestyle, the past comes alive. Jai Vilas is an Italianate structure which combines the Tuscan and Corinthian architectural modes. The imposing Darbar Hall has two central chandeliers, weighing a couple of tonnes, and hung only after ten elephants had tested the strength of the roof. Ceilings picked out in gilt, heavy draperies and tapestries, fine Persian carpets, and antique furniture from France and Italy are features of these spacious rooms. Eye-catching treasures include: a silver train with cut-glass wagons which served guests as it chugged around on miniature rails on the tables; a glass cradle from Italy used for the baby Krishna each Janamashtami; silver dinner services and swords that were once worn by Aurangzeb and Shah Jehan.
There are, besides, personal mementoes of the past members of the Scindia family: the jewelled slippers that belonged to Chinkoo Rani, four-poster beds, gifts from practically every country in the world, hunting trophies and portraits. The Scindia Museum offers an unparalleled glimpse into the rich culture and lifestyle of princely India.</p> <p><b>Open everyday except Wednesday from 10 am to 5.30 pm. Entry fees are Rs. 40/- for Indian and Rs. 300/- for foreign visitors.

<h3>Monuments</h3>
<p>The father of Hindustani classical music, the great Tansen, one of the ‘nine Jewels’ of Akbar’s court, lies buried in Gwalior. The memorial to this great musician has a pristine simplicity about it, and is built in the early Mughal architectural style. More than a monument, the Tansen’s Tomb is part of Gwalior’s living cultural heritage; it is the venue of a music festival on a national scale held annually in November-December. Leading musicians of the country gather here to give performances during the festival. More opulent than Tansen’s Tomb, is the sandstone mausoleum of the Afghan prince, Ghous Mohammed, also designed on early Mughal lines. Particularly, exquisite are the screens which use the pierced stone technique, as delicate as lace. The earliest freedom fighters, Tatya Tope and the indomitable Rani of Jhansi, are commemorated in memorials in Gwalior. There are cenotaphs at major public crossings, memorials to Scindia kings and queens. Throughout the city, there are these reminders of a proud past, of the great men and women of Gwalior who have their place in the nation’s roll of honour. Located near the Residency at Morar, the newly constructed Sun Temple takes its inspiration from the famous Konark Sun Temple in Orissa.</p>

<h3>Art Gallaries and Museum</h3>
<p>The Gujari Mahal Archaeological Museum houses rare antiquities, some of them dating back to the 1st century AD. Even though many of these have been defaced by the iconoclastic Mughals, their perfection of form has survived the ravages of time. Particularly worth seeing is the statue of Shalbhanjika from Gyraspur, the tree goddess, epitome of perfection in miniature. The statue is kept in the custody of the museum's curator, and can be seen on request. The museum is open every day except Monday, from 10 am to 5 pm. The Kala Vithika is another treasure house of the arts. It remains closed on Sunday and public holidays. The Municipal Corporation Museum, which is open all days except Mondays, has a very fine natural history section.
The old ancestral house of the legendry Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan has recently been converted into ‘ Sarod Ghar’ – Museum of Music by the Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan Memorial Trust under the patronage and guidance of his great son and sarod maestro Ustad Amzad Ali Khan. The museum has been rebuilt keeping in mind the old traditional architecture of Gwalior and houses in it ancient instruments of the great Indian Masters of yesteryears.

<h3>The Temples</h3>
<p>The architectural style of the Khajuraho temples is very different from the temple prototype of that period. Each stands, instead of within the customary enclosure, on a high masonry platform. Combined with the upward direction of the structure, which is further accentuated by vertical projections, the total effect is one of grace and lightness, reminiscent of the Himalayan peaks. Each of the chief compartments has its own roof, grouped in such a way that the highest is in the centre, the lowest over the portico, a triumph of skill and imagination in recreating the rising peaks of a range. The temples of Khajuraho are divided into three geographical groups: Western, Eastern and Southern.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>The Western Group</h3>
<p>This is certainly the best known, because it is to this group that the largest and most typical Khajuraho temple belongs: The Kandariya Mahadev. Perfectly symmetrical, it soars 31 km high. Though the four temples that stand at the corners of the main shrine are now in ruins, the main shrine has an exquisitely carved entrance arch with a multitude of themes. Celestial beings, lovers serenading musicians... movements captured in stone, frozen in time, yet retaining a quality of warm, pulsating life. The very stone seems to have taken on the living, breathing quality of the carved figures.
Beyond the archway of the Kandariya Mahadev, lie the six interior compartments; the portico, main hall, transept, vestibule, sanctum and ambulatory. The ceilings are particularly noteworthy and the pillars supporting them have intricately carved capitals. The transept's outer walls have three horizontal panels showing deities of the Hindu pantheon, and groups of lovers, a pageant of sensuousness, vibrantly alive.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>The Eastern Group</h3>
<p>Hindu and Jain temples make up the Eastern Group, which lies close to the Khajuraho village. The largest Jain temple, Parswanath, is in this group. Exquisite in detail, the sculptures on the northern outer wall make this temple perhaps the finest in the group. The themes of these carvings are the timeless ones of every day, mortal activity. A woman sits bent pensively on a letter; a lovely young girl removes a thorn from her foot, the master craftsmen of Khajuraho display here their deep understanding of the trifles that make up a human life. Within, the sanctum has a throne, which faces a bull : emblem of the first tirthankara, Adinath. The actual image of Parswanath from which the temple derives its name was installed as recently as 1860. The other Jain temple in this group is the Ghantai Temple. Though almost in ruins now, it still bears evidence of its original splendour. Particularly, arresting is the frieze which depicts, in graphic detail, the 16 dreams of Mahavira's mother and a multi-armed Jain goddess riding on a winged Garuda. North of Parswanatha is the more modestly sized Adinatha Temple. The three Hindu temples in the Eastern Group are the Brahma, Vamana and Javari Temples. A double row of apsaras, celestial nymphs, adorn the outer walls of the Vamana temple. A variety of sensuous attitudes: languid, provocative, mischievously inviting, give credibility to the theory that Khajuraho's erotica were meant to test the devotees who came to worship their gods at the temples.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>The Southern Group</h3>
<p>5 km from the Khajuraho village, lies the Southern Group of temples. The fine Chaturbhuj Temple in this group has a massive intricately carved image of Vishnu in the sanctum. Duladeo Temple, another of the southern group, is a little away from the road to the Jain group of temples. Though remains of temples belonging to the Khajuraho group have been discovered at Jatkari, 3 km away and even at Maribag in Rewa, it is at the 3 main groups that the imperishable glory of Khajuraho, the sensuous celebration of life, the aspiration towards the infinite, remains.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>The Lights and the Sound Show</h3>
<p>This fascinating Son-et-Lumiere spectacle evokes the life and times of the great Chandela Kings and traces the story of the unique temples from the 10th Century to the present day.Mounted in the complex of the Western Group of temples, the 50-minute show runs in Hindi and in English every evening. Amitabh Bachchan, the Indian super star, narrates the story of Khajuraho in his mesmerising voice.
Timings of Sound & Light Show at Western group of temples: English: 06:30 pm to 07:25 pm. Hindi: 07:40 pm to 08:35 pm.
Entry fees: Foreign Adult: Rs. 350/- Foreign child: Rs. 200/- Indian Adult: Rs. 120/- Indian Child: Rs. 60/-</p>

<h3>Rajgaddi and Rajwada</h3>
<p>A life-size statue of Rani Ahilyabai sits on a throne in the Rajgaddi within the fort complex. This is the right place to begin a tour of Maheshwar, for this pious and wise queen was the architect of its revived importance. Other fascinating relics and heirlooms of the Holkar dynasty can be seen in the other rooms which are open to the public. Within the complex is an exquisite small shrine which is a starting point of the ancient Dussehra ceremony which is carried out even today. The image on this day is installed reverently in a splendid palanquin and carried down the steep fort road to the town below to receive the yearly homage of the people of Maheshwar</p>

The construction of this strong and imposing fort could become possible due to solid muram and black stone of this hillock. The main entrance of the fort was built to the west.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the diary (Rojnamcha) of Emperor Jehangir this was built by Mohammad Tughlak in 1344 A.D. In 1732 A.D. the rulers of Pawar Dynasty captured the construction plan of the fort suggests that it was built following the injunctions of Samrangan Sutradhar. Kharbuja Mahal and Sheesh Mahal are some of the important buildings in this fort. The Kharbuja Mahal was built in 16th century A.D. This palace is called as Kharbuja Mahal because of its musk melon shape. During the Maratha struggle, Anandi Bai, the wife of Raghunath Rao took shelter here. She gave birth to Peshwa Bajirao II in this palace.

<h3>The Darwazas</h3>
<p>The 45 km parapets of walls that encircle Mandu are punctuated by 12 gateways. Most notable of these is Delhi Darwaza, the main entrance to the fortress city, for which the approach is through a series of gateways well-fortified with walled enclosures and strengthened by bastions such as the Alamgir and Bhangi Darwaza, through which the present road passes. Rampol Darwaza, Jehangir Gate and Tarapur Gate are some of the other main gateways.</p>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Jahaz Mahal</h3>
<p>This 120 mt long "ship palace" built between the two artificial lakes, Munj Talao and Kapur Talao is an elegant two storeyed palace. Probably it was built by Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din-Khilji for his large harem. With its open pavilions, balconies overhanging the water and open terrace, Jahaz Mahal is an imaginative recreation in stone of a royal pleasure craft. Viewed on moonlit nights from the adjoining Taveli Mahal, the silhouette of the building, with the tiny domes and turrets of the pavilion gracefully perched on the terrace, presents an unforgettable spectacle.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Hindola Mahal</h3>
<p>An audience hall, also belonging to Ghiyas-ud-din's reign, it derives its name of "swinging palace" from its sloping sidewalls. Superb and innovative techniques are also evident in its ornamental facade, delicate trellis work in sand-stone and beautifully moulded columns. To the West of Hindola Mahal there are several unidentified buildings which still bear traces of their past grandeur. Amidst these is an elaborately constructed well called Champa Baoli which is connected with underground vaulted rooms where arrangements for cold and hot water were made. Other places of interest in this enclave are Dilawar Khan's Mosque, the Nahar Jharokha (tiger balcony), Taveli Mahal, the two large wells called the Ujali (bright) and Andheri (dark) Baolis and Gada Shah's Shop and House, all worth a visit. </p>

<h3>Hoshang Shah's Tomb</h3>
<p>India's first marble edifice, it is one of the most refined examples of Afghan architecture. Its unique features are the magnificently proportioned dome, marble lattice work of remarkable delicacy and porticoed courts and towers to mark the four corners of the rectangle. Shah Jehan sent four of his great architects to study the design of and draw inspiration from the Tomb. Among them was Ustad Hamid, who was also associated with the construction of Taj Mahal. </p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Jami Msajid</h3>
<p>Inspired by the great mosque of Damascus, the Jami Masjid was conceived on a grand scale, with a high plinth and a huge domed porch projecting in the centre, the background dominated by similar imposing domes with the intervening space filled up by innumerable domes. One is struck by the huge proportions and the stern simplicity of its construction. The great court of the mosque is enclosed on all sides by huge colonnades with a rich and pleasing variety in the arrangement of arches, pillars, number of bays, and in the rows of domes above.</p>

<h3>Roopmati's Pavilion</h3>
<p>The pavilion was originally built as an army observation post. From its hilltop perch, this graceful structure with its two pavilions was a retreat of the lovely queen, from where she could see Baz Bahadur's palace and the Narmada flowing through the Nimar plains far below.</p>
</div>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Nilkanth Mahal</h3>
<p>Belonging to the Mughal era and close to the Nilkanth shrine, this palace was constructed by the Mughal governor, Shah Badgah Khan for Emperor Akbar's Hindu wife. On the walls here are some inscriptions of the time of Akbar referring to the futility of earthly pomp and glory. Hathi Mahal, Darya Khan's Tomb, Dai ka Mahal, Dai ki Chhotti Behan Ka Mahal, Malik Mughit's Mosque and Jali Mahal are some of the other fascinating monuments. There is also the Echo Point, the 'Delphic Oracle' of Mandu. A shout from here reverberates far below and is heard clearly back. The Lohani Caves and Temple Ruins, not far from the royal enclave area also merit a visit due to their association with Mandu's history and monuments. Sunset Point, in front of the caves affords a panoramic view of the surrounding countryside.</p>

<h3>Parasailing in Pachmarhi</h3>
<p>It looks difficult but is not really; though it is every bit as exciting. Strapped into safety gear, a crash helmet and a parachute, visitors are towed behind a jeep till the parachute fills with air and carries them into the sky. From there, after having been borne on the wings if the wind for a few minutes, parasialers descend to earth to be received by their handlers in a soft handling. Most parasailers in Pachmari are beginners with no previous experience of this exhilarating air sport.s</p>

<h3>Boating</h3>
<p>Soaring in glittering splendor, the Marble Rocks at Bhedaghat rise to a hundred feet on either side of the Narmada. The perpendicular magnesium limestone rocks fringe the crystal waters of the Narmada providing the perfect reason to take a boat down the glistening water. Boating on a moonlit night, when the whole stretch of water is transformed into a sheet of liquid silver is absolutely magical.</p>

Such fossils are found in three other villages of the district also, which lie outside the national park. In Ghuguwa and Umaria the standing, petrified trunks of trees have been identified as Gymnosperms and Angiosperms- Monocotyledons and palms. There are certain Bryophytes also. There is some doubt about whether the fossils are from the late Jurassic or the early and mid-Cretaceous age. This is because when the breakup of the single land mass, Pangaea occurred, it was split by the continental drift into Laurasia and Gondwanaland somewhere between the Jurassic and Cretaceous ages. India formed a part of Gondwanaland. Interspersed with the plant fossils are to be found the fossils of molluscs. One theory is that the area in which the fossils are located, i.e., the Narmada Valley near Mandla, was actually a deep inundation of the sea into peninsular India till the Post- Cambrian Tertiary age, about 40 million years ago. This means that Narmada was a very short river which terminated in the inland sea above Mandla, and that the recession of the sea caused geological disturbances, which created the present rift valley through which the Narmada River and Tapti River flow in their present journey to the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>The fossils look like ordinary rocks and are either removed from the fields unwittingly by agriculturists or are damaged by tourists and those unscrupulous people who think they can make quick money out of their sale.</p>

Its status was further upgraded to a national park in 1955. The habitat has an excellent interspersion of geographical attributes and welfare factors which foster a rich slideupulation of wildlife. Kanha is virtually a tiger land, with several tigresses occupying traditionally famous natal areas. Several pockets of high density areas lead to competition amongst tigers for food and space with several signs indicating their presence. Inter group fights among tigers and cub morality caused by male tigers is common in Khana. There is a rich assemblage of co-predators and prey animals. Packs of Wild dogs chasing large herds of Spotted deer are a commonsight in Kanha. Perhaps the most precious animal of Kanha is the Central Indian Barasingha. This Swamp deer is the last world slideupulation of the hard ground subspecies, which has virtually been saved from extinction owing to concerned efforts under Project Tiger. Barasinghas have also been located successfully to the eastern Halon Valley of the park, which was their original home.</p><p>Other common animals found in the reserve are leopard, Spotted deer, Sambar, Wild pigs, Grey langur and more than 300 species of birds. The places of tourist attraction here are Shravan Tal, Shravan Chita, Macha Dongar, Bamni Dadar famous for breathtaking sunset view, orientation centre/museum and grasslands of Mukki and Sonf. Similar to Bandhavgarh, Kanha also allows wildlife lovers to catch glimpses of natives from an elephant back apart from jungle excursions in open vehicles.</p>

Madhav National Park has been the hunting preserve of the Maharajas of Gwalior, and is one of the oldest protected areas of Madhya Pradesh.</p><p>The Shivpuri area is legendary for its faunal riches. It is said that Emperor Akbar, while returning from Malwa in 1854, captured a large number of wild elephants in its forests. However, at present there are no elephants in this tract. During 1956, an area of 165.32 sq km was notified as a national park under the Madhya Bharat National Park Act of 1955. Subsequently, the area has been increased to 354.61 sq km. The common fauna in Madhav National Park include leopard, Wild dog, wolf, jackal, hyena, Spotted deer, Nilgai, Chinkara, Chowsingha and Wild pig. There are reports of tigers straying into the area from adjoining forests. More than 227 species of birds can be seen, and a large number of migratory birds visit the park during winter – Spots bills, pelicans, Spoon bills, Brahminy ducks and Bar headed geese. The lakes have a large variety of fishes. The places of tourist attraction in the area include SakhyaSagar Lake, Sailing Club and shooting box, Madhav Lake, George Castle, BhuraKho, JalMandir and Siddha Baba.</p>

Like Bandhavgarh, Panna was also the hunting reserve of its erstwhile rulers of Chhatarpur and Bijawar princely states. The Gangau Wildlife Sanctuary comprising of forests of Panna Forest Divisions (north and south) was created in 1975. The area was enlarged and its legal status elevated to a national park during 1981. The protected area was brought under Project Tiger in 1994. Panna is rather an open, dry landspace, with the topography and water distribution governing the spatial presence of wild animals. There is a significant drop in elevations, locally known as seha. These places provide adequate cover for wild animals. Vultures and other raptors roosting on cliffs along the river course are a common sight in Panna. The fauna consists of tiger, leopard, Chowsingha, Sloth bear, Nilgai, Chinkara, hyena and small groups of Chital. More than 200 species of birds have been spotted. Both Gharial and Mugger are found in the Ken River. The places of tourist interest in Panna are Pandava Fall, Kamasan Fall, Dhundhawa Fall, Bhauradeh Fall, Bhadar and Badgadi Fall, Raneh Fall and cave paintings.

The area was declared a sanctuary in 1977 and portions of it were elevated as a national park in 1983. During 1992 these areas were brought under the coverage of Project Tiger. The landscape is also the setting for Rudyard Kipling's famous Jungle Book and its Mowgli stories. It is believed that Kipling was inspired by Sir William Henry Sleeman's account of a boy believed to have been raised by wolves, in the village of SantBaori in the Seoni district. Pench has a good tiger slideupulation, and the litter size more often is big enough to have four cubs. Co-predators like the Wild dog and leopard are very common. The herbivores include Sambar, Chital, Nilgai, Chowsingha, Chinkara, Barking deer, Gaur and Wild pig. The most commonly found omnivore is a Sloth bear. More than 280 bird species have check listed. The common ones include cormorants, darters, herons, egrets, White neck storks, White ibises, Black ibises, Pintail ducks, Brahminy ducks, Fishing eagles, shrikes and wagtails. Four species of vultures – the White rumped, Long billed, White scavenger and the King are seen in the reserve. The famous tourist attractions in the reserve include Totladoh Dam, Karmajhiri, Kalapahad, Chhindimatta, Bison Camp and Bison Retreat.

	<h3>Badal Mahal, Chanderi</h3>
	<p>This is a tall, slim, rather elaborate arch that leads nowhere. There is no building either in front or behind it. There is also no local legend that might explain its purpose. The palace is called a 'cloud mansion', as it was meant to serve as the entrance to the summer resort cooled by flowing water simulating monsoon showers. This, however is just informed speculation based on 'Badal Mahals' in other parts of India.</p>

	<p>Hardaul was a saintly prince who was a worshipped as god, and even today, the villages of Bundelkhad have shrines worshipping him. Born as son of Bir Singh JuDeo, Hardaul died to prove his innocence to his elder brother (Jhujhar Singh) who cast doubts on the latter's consort</p>

	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Gauhar Mahal, Bhopal</h3>
	<p>This Palace is interesting from both an architectural and a shopping point of view. there is hall of public audience, or Diwan-i-Aam, from where the rulers appeared before the subject. To the left of the court, a passage leads to another court which was, in all likelihood, the hall of private audience, the Diwan-i-Khas.Very pragmatically, both courts are now being used as a handicrafts market and serve as a relaxing shoppers' shop after their trudge around the monuments.</p>

	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Gujari Mahal, Gwalior</h3>
	<p>The Gujari Mahal lies within the Gwalior fort. It is considered to be a marvel of medieval architecture. The 15th century Gujari Mahal is a monument to the love of Raja Mansingh Tomar for his intrepid Gujar queen, Mrignani.The outer structure of the Gujari Mahal has survived in ana almost total state of preservation; the interior has been converted into an Archeological Museum housing are antiquities, some of them dating back to the 1st century AD. Even though many of these have been defaced by the iconoclastic Mughals, their perfection of form has survived the ravages of time.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Hindola Mahal, Mandu</h3>
	<p>An audience hall also belonging to Ghiyas-ud-din's reign, it derives the name of 'Swinging Palace' from its sloping sidewalls. Superb and innovative techniques are also evident in its ornamental facade, delicate trellis work in sandstone and beautifully moulded columns.To the west of Hindola Mahal there are several unidentified buildings which still bear traces of their past grandeur. Amidst these is an elaborately constructed well called Champa Baoli which is connected with underground vaulted rooms where arrangements for cold and hot water were made. There is also a Hamam, or bath-house, in this living complex. It has apertures like stars cut into its ceiling.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Hathi Mahal, Mandu</h3>
	<p>This palace is a massive building with enormously broad pillars that give it its name: the Elephant Palace.It is crowned by a huge dome. Judging from its design it seems to have been planned as a summer house, a place designed to catch the slightest breeze and cool its occupants in the heat of the summer. It was later converted into a mausoleum, because it holds a tomb, a detached caravanserai, and a mosque nearby.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Jai Vilas Palace, Gwalior</h3>
	<p>This elegant white sprawling building, completed in 1874 when Britian's Queen Victoria was at the height of her power as the Empress of India, took nine years to build. It was designed by a remarkable polymath and genius, named Sir Micheal Filose. He had been born in Gwalior, had been a playmate of the prince who became the ruler of the state, and was a man of remarkably eclectic tastes able to encompass the best of the pomp and grandeur of both Indian and European palaces. He chose his inspiration the architectural idiom of Tuscany: possibly because there. Too, the warmth of the east had blended with the precision of the west.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Jal Mahal, Mandu</h3>
	<p>This water palace has two halls with valued ceilings and seems to have been meant for the use of its rulers. Its marble walls, with medallions of blue and yellow with inscriptions, give it a certain regal air. But though it has not been dated it is likely that it was constructed after the Khalji era. It was probably built to offer a private escape for royal couples.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Jehangir Mahal, Orchha</h3>
	<p>This massive palace was, apparently, built by Bir Singh Deo for the Mughal Emperor Jehangir though it is not certain if he ever stayed in it. It is, in every way, more powerful, more richly endowed with architectural embellishments, and far more beautiful than the Raj Mahal Palace. Some architects believe that this is the epitome of Indo-Islamic architecture though it veers, in many ways, from the Islamic style.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Kharbuja Mahal, Dhar</h3>
	<p>A 'kharbuja' is a melon and the palace got its name from its domes which looked like large melons. Apart from their aesthetic appeal and conforming to a typical Islamic architectural mode, they also kept their buildings cool, allowing hot air from the rooms to rise inside the dome and away from the living spaces. There it would be radiated away from the surface of the dome</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Koshak Mahal, Chanderi</h3>
	<p>On the secular buildings in Chanderi, the majestic Koshak Mahal, 4 kms from the town centre, is the most significant. Set in landscaped gardens, only three and a half floors of the original seven-storey structure survive. The palace is said to have been built by Mahmud Shah for his wife, Koshak, who gave birth to their child here. He named the palace after her and it was originally named Koshak Hafta; hafta (Urdu for week) denoting its seven floors.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Lalbagh Palace, Indore</h3>
	<p>The Lalbagh Palace has an architecture influenced by the Europeans. It almost seems as if every extravagant style, every new whim of European architects, was incorporated in the palace and its furnishings. Thus, a walk around the Lalbagh could become a lesson, for students of Design, in the variations of decor and form that Europeans evolved for their homes over many decades. If technical terms are of interest to the visitor, then the architecture is a blend of Renaissance, Palladian and Baroque. The pillars in the palace rise in the three classic styles: Doric, Ionian and Corinthian. Also there are Greek and Latin mythological sculptures and paintings of Poseiden and Demeter, Helios and Hephaistos long with naiads, griffins and cherubs floating across the painted ceilings. And naturally, there are chandeliers, expensive drapes, and huge mirrors to replicate all this exuberance over and over again.</p>

	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Moti Mahal:Jahaz Mahal, Mandu</h3>
	<p>Moti Mahal is a massive building situated by the museum near Chhatri of Rani LaxamiBai. At present it houses the office of the Commissioner. MotiMahal was built by Srimant Maharaja JiwajiRaoScindia in 1827 A.D with its auditorium acting as an assembly hall of Madhya Bharat during the regime of the Scindias. The wall paintings in the Ragmala Hall are fascinating. Take a few minutes to marvel at the paintings depicting Dussehra festival (celebrated by the Scindial family) and Radha-Krishna.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Nilakantha Palace, Mandu</h3>
	<p>This beautiful princely residence was built in the 16th century by the governor of the fort, Shah Budagh Khan. It is a most unusual building set against a cutaway section of the hillside. The three sides of the palace have high walls, with Islamic arches and alcoves and little lamp niches. There is a lofty platform which leads to a large room with an arched and open front. With its uninterrupted views of the valley, this grotto of a palace must have been a cool, green, serene escape all through the year.Today, it has been converted into a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva of the Blue Throat, Nilakantha.</p>

	<h3>Rai Praveen Mahal, Orchha</h3>
	<p>Rai Praveen was the favourite mistress of Raja Indramani (1672 – 75) when the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb was on the throne. This elegant, double-storeyed, brick building looks more like Mughal than Bundela. It has a main hall, terraces overlooking its formal gardens, little chambers, and is filled with light and air. Rai Praveen was a skilled dancer, singer, musician and a poetess who was associated with the great Hindi poet Keshav Dass.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Raj Mahal Palace, Orchha</h3>
	<p>This palace was Bir Singh Deo's main palace and is sometimes referred to as the Raja Mahal. It is a solid, square structure and, since it is built on a hillock, two wings have five storeys on three sides and fourstoreys on one side. The Halls of Private Audience and of Public Audience are imposing. The palace has a King's chamber as the sanctum of the Chatturbhuj temple, opposing, offering a private view of the idol enshrined within it.The ceilings of this and the other chambers have been delicately painted. There are other paintings on the walls, some illustrating scenes from the epic Ramayana, others capturing the pomp and glory of the Bundela court. There is also a system through which natural lighting falls down the angled shafts. These ensure privacy while allowing sunlight to illuminate the rooms. So, too, do the beautifully cut stone-work grilles.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Rajwada Palace, Indore</h3>
	<p>Unlike the Lalbagh that stands aloof in the midst of extensive grounds the Rajwada stands in the heart of the busiest part of the town. It has a garden with a statue of the great queen Ahilyabai. The facade which encloses the gateway of the Rajwada Palace gives the impression rather forbidding wizard's castel. The three lower storeys have been painted a dark brown. The three floors rising above them have their windows outlined in white giving the impression of multiple eyes gazing down at one from a well-defined fortress.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Sheesh Mahal, Orchha</h3>
	<p>The palace was built by the ruler Udait Singh in the 18th century as his personal rest house. It is a double-storeyed building, virtually an annex of the Jehangir Mahal, full of stairways winding through the thick walls accessing curious little rooms, a couple of courts and a few large rooms. One of them had mirror chips in the ceiling and a strategically-placed, full-length, cheval mirror which, from the enormous double bed, gave uninterrupted views of the huge stone tub in the bathroom. The Palace is now taken over by the MP Tourism Development Corporation and is rub as a hotel and restaurant.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Sunder Mahal, Orchha</h3>
	<p>Almost in ruins this small palace is flocked by Muslim pilgrims. The palace was built by Prince Dhurbhajan, the son of King Jhujhar Singh. Surprisingly Dhurbhajan married a Muslim girl and after converting himself and later devoting his life to prayer and meditation. Just like HardaulSamadhhi, Dhurbhajan is revered as a saint.</p>
	</div>
	<div data-role="collapsible">
	<h3>Vir Mahal or Bir Singh's Palace, Datia</h3>
	<p>It is an impressive structure crowning a scrub-covered hill. When seen from below, its reflection in an ancient reservoir at its feet makes it seem as if wavering illusion is emerging into reality. Massive encircling walls, heavy terraces rising to pavilions and squat cupolas, and the upward thrusting central floor growing like the bud of an ominous mushroom, give the impression of implacable and menacing authority.The main gateway rises through arches and galleries which have a certain unexpected delicacy. Bundela architecture is full of such seemingly inconsistent touches. Bir Singh's overlords, the Mughals, had a strong Persian orientation in their culture and mores. In fact many of the ceilings inside in the palace have borders and medallions which seem to have been drawn from the rare carpets of Persia.</p>
